# ü¶ã GMODebate.org's eBook Collection

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the eBook archive of GMODebate.org. This archive represents years of philosophical inquiry and investigative work into topics ranging from eugenics to the 9/11 Truth movement.

## A Note from the Founder

Hello, I'm Jan Jaap Hakvoort, founder of PageSpeed.pro and GMODebate.org. If you're a web developer, SEO specialist, or a former customer of PageSpeed.pro, you might be wondering what happened to our optimization services and why I'm now publishing philosophical content.

### The PageSpeed.pro Story

In 2016, our popular WordPress optimization plugin, used by over 20,000 professionals, was mysteriously banned from the WordPress repository. This event, coupled with other concerning incidents, led to the suspension of PageSpeed.pro's operations in 2019.

For those seeking more information about the WordPress ban, please visit [this page](https://gmodebate.github.io/911-truth/#wordpress).

### From Web Optimization to Philosophical Inquiry

Following these events, I dedicated four years to intensive philosophical study and investigation into the circumstances surrounding various incidents, including an attack on my home in 2019.

During this time, I uncovered potential connections between the WordPress ban, actions by Rabobank (a Fortune 500 company), and other events that seemed to be reactions to my investigative work. You can read more about the Rabobank situation [here](https://gmodebate.github.io/rabobank/).

- Rabobank attempted to sabotage the business between 2015-2019 and among other things, connect me with the head of performance of Google China.
- A Vice President of üí≥ Mastercard said that he ‚Äú_knew what happened_‚Äù and became one of the first and last customers of PageSpeed.pro‚Äôs advanced FEO optimization plugin in 2019. He paid 5,000 euro for a WordPress optimization.

## To My Former Clients and Colleagues

If you're a former client or colleague from my PageSpeed.pro days, I want to express my gratitude for your past support. The abrupt end of our business was not by choice, but rather the result of a complex series of events that led me down this new path of inquiry.
